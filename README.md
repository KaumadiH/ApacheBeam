# Apache Beam Pipeline for Skill Migration Analysis

This document provides a step-by-step guide to set up and run an Apache Beam pipeline to analyze skill migration data using Google Cloud Dataflow.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured
- A Google Cloud project with Dataflow API enabled
- Necessary permissions to read from and write to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

## Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
!pip install --upgrade apache-beam
!pip install apache-beam[gcp]
```

## Running the Pipeline
To run the pipeline, use the following command:

```bash
python your_pipeline_script.py \
    --runner=DataflowRunner \
    --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
    --region=YOUR_REGION \
    --staging_location=gs://YOUR_BUCKET/staging \
    --temp_location=gs://YOUR_BUCKET/temp
```
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID, YOUR_REGION, and YOUR_BUCKET with your Google Cloud project ID, region, and GCS bucket names, respectively.

## Visualization
After running the pipeline, visualizations will be saved as images:

- in_demand_skills.png: Bar chart of the top 10 in-demand skills.
- geographic_distribution.png: Choropleth map showing the geographic distribution of skills migration jobs.

## Conclusion
This guide provides the necessary steps to set up, run, and visualize data from an Apache Beam pipeline on Google Cloud Dataflow. Adjust the pipeline code and parameters as needed for your specific use case.
